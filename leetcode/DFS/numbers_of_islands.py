##Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water),
# count the number of islands.
# An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.
# You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
# Example 1:
# Input:
# 11110
# 11010
# 11000
# 00000
# Output:Â 1
# Example 2:
# Input:
# 11000
# 11000
# 00100
# 00011
# Output: 3
