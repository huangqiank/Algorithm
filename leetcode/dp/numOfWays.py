##1411. Number of Ways to Paint N Ã— 3 Grid
#You have a grid of size n x 3 and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: Red, Yellow, or Green while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).
#Given n the number of rows of the grid, return the number of ways you can paint this grid. As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 109 + 7.
#example 1:Input: n = 1
#Output: 12
#Explanation: There are 12 possible way to paint the grid as shown.

class Solution:
    def numOfWays(self, n: int) -> int:
        dif = 6
        same = 6
        for i in range(1,n) :
            next_dif = same*2 + dif *2
            next_same = 3*same + 2*dif
            dif,same = next_dif,next_same

        return (dif + same) % (10**9+7)
