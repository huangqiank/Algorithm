##Given a linked list,
##return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle,
##return null.
##To represent a cycle in the given linked list,
##we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed)Â in the linked list
##where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.
##Note: Do not modify the linked list.
##Example 1:
##Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
##Output: tail connects to node index 1
##Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
