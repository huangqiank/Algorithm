##Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.
##To represent a cycle in the given linked list,
# we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed)Â in the linked list
# where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.
##Example 1:
##Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
##Output: true
##Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
##Example 2:
##Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
##Output: true
##Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
##Example 3:

##Input: head = [1], pos = -1
##Output: false
##Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
